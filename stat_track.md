title: Mathematics Major: Statistics Track
---

The statistics track to the mathematics major is intended for students interested in careers or graduate school in statistics and data science. 

Students planning to attend graduate school in statistics are encouraged to take additional mathematics courses, and might find it advantageous to complete the mathematics major (non-statistics track), along with the statistics and data science minor.
