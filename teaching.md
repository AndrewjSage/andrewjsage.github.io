A conversation that leads another person to share my enthusiasm statistical investigation carries great intrinsic reward. As a teacher, I get to engage in these conversations every day. I enjoy working closely with students to help them develop the skills and judgement needed to make responsible data-driven decisions and critique faulty arguments they are sure to encounter in their everyday lives. I employ a variety of inclusive pedagogical strategies designed to create a learning-centered environment rooted in high expectations and transparency. I want my students to know that I value them as individuals and care about supporting their success. Most of all, I want them to feel empowered in the knowledge that they are capable of doing hard things.

I teach a variety of statistics and data classes including:   

* STAT 107: *Principles of Statistics*
* CMSC/STAT 205: *Data-Scientific Programming*
* STAT 255: *Statistics for Data Science*  
* MATH/STAT 340: *Probability*
* STAT 455: *Advanced Statistical Modeling*  

Here are class notes for <a href="https://stat255-lu.github.io/Notes/"> STAT 255 </a> and <a href="https://stat455-w22.github.io/stat455-w22-notes/"> STAT 455 </a> in Bookdown format. 


I enjoy reading articles and books about teaching and learning, and thinking about how I can apply new ideas to improve my students' experiences. I have found the following resources especially enlightening.
