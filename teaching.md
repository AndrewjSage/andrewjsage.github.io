My teaching philosphy is based on four core beliefs, which are listed below. Robert Leamnson's article, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00091380009601765"> *Learning as Biological Brain Change* </a> (published in *Change: The magazine of higher learning* (2000)) played an influential role in forming these beliefs. 

1) Learning occurs in a person's brain and hence individuals are ultimately responsible for their own learning. However, external factors (e.g. teachers, classmates) play an important role by creating opportunities and experiences that facilitate learning.  

2) Learning is a social process. As teachers can attest, we know that we understand something when we are able to explain it to others.  

3) Emotion is central to learning. As Leamnson writes, we learn the things that capture our imagination!  

4) Learning results from engaging the brain in thought, and then reflecting on that thinking. 

It is important for students to know that I want them to succeed and I strive to create an environment where students are comfortable and willing to take risks. Carefully designed team interactions offer tremendous learning opportunities and I seek out ways to create these interactions in my classes. No one will deny that we learn best when working with topics that excite us. I believe that we should embrace the role of emotion in learning. When students see statistics as a vehicle for exploring issues they care about, learning is enhanced. Finally, it is important to frequently reflect on how our thinking has changed as a result of new experiences. Reflection allows learning to truly set in, and we benefit by intentionally reflecting on how a lesson or activity has changed the way we think. 


I hope that my classes will help students see statistics as an investigative process, focused on making and defending decisions using data. Statistics courses must develop students' abilities to reason with data, as opposed to memorizing and/or plugging into formulas. I am a proponent of simulation-based inference, which has been shown to enhance the statistical reasoning abilities of undergraduate students. I am interested in developing and implementing activities using simulation-based inference at all levels of the undergraduate statistics curriculum. 

My collegiate teaching experience includes the following courses. 

**Iowa State University:**

* STAT 231: Probability and Statistical Inference for Engineers (Spring & Fall 2017, Spring 2018) 

* STAT 330: Probability and Statistics for Computer Science (Fall 2016)

* STAT 104: Introduction to Statistics (Fall 2014) 

**Miami University**

* MATH 151: Calculus I (Spring 2013)

* MATH 123: Precalculus (Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013)

Before pursuing graduate school, I enjoyed four years as a mathematics teacher at <a href="https://www.bloomfieldmespolocal.org/"> Bloomfield High School </a> in Northeastern Ohio, where I taught courses ranging from geometry through calculus.
