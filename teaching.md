When I am excited  by a topic, my first reaction is to share it, in hope of inspiring the same enthusiasm in others. When my students share my passion for analyzing data, this brings me great intrinsic reward. I find personal and small group interactions with my students very valuable and I try to create opportunities for these to occur both inside and outside the classroom. It is important that my students know I want them to succeed and I strive to create an environment where students are comfortable taking risks that will result in learning. 

Learning results from engagement of the brain and subsequent reflection. It is my responsibility as an educator to create situations for this to occur. Through my participation in Iowa State's Preparing Future Faculty program and Project LEA/RN, I work with experts in the University's Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching to design and implement active learning strategies in my classes. 

My collegiate teaching experience includes the following courses. 

**Iowa State University:**

* STAT 231: Probability and Statistical Inference for Engineers (Spring 2017, and will teach Fall 2017) 

* STAT 330: Probability and Statistics for Computer Science (Fall 2016)

* STAT 104: Introduction to Statistics (Fall 2014) 

**Miami University**

* MATH 151: Calculus I (Spring 2013)

* MATH 123: Precalculus (Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013)


Before pursuing graduate school, I enjoyed four years as a mathematics teacher at Bloomfield High School in Northeastern Ohio, where I taught courses ranging from geometry through calculus.
