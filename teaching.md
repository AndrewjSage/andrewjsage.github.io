When I find a topic exciting, my first reaction is to share it, in hope of inspiring the same enthusiasm in others. When my students share my passion for analyzing data, it brings great intrinsic reward. I find tremendous value in individual and small group interactions with my students and try to create opportunities for these to occur inside and outside the classroom. It is important for my students to know that I want them to succeed and I strive to create an environment where students are comfortable and willing to take risks. 

Learning results from engagement of the brain and subsequent reflection. As an educator, I seek to create situations where these occur.  See <a href="https://andrewjsage.github.io/projects/"> Activities & Projects </a> for examples of a group project and in-class lab activity that I designed and used in my Spring 2017 engineering statistics course. Through participation in Iowa State's <a href="http://www.celt.iastate.edu/graduate-students-postdocs/preparing-future-faculty"> Preparing Future Faculty program</a>, I work with experts in the University's <a href="http://www.celt.iastate.edu/"> Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching  </a> to develop effective strategies for active learning. I frequently use think-pair-share and <a href="https://kahoot.com/"> *Kahoot!* </a> games during class in order to engage students in active learning and obtain immediate feedback. 

My collegiate teaching experience includes the following courses. 

**Iowa State University:**

* STAT 231: Probability and Statistical Inference for Engineers (Spring 2017, Fall 2017) 

* STAT 330: Probability and Statistics for Computer Science (Fall 2016)

* STAT 104: Introduction to Statistics (Fall 2014) 

**Miami University**

* MATH 151: Calculus I (Spring 2013)

* MATH 123: Precalculus (Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013)

Before pursuing graduate school, I enjoyed four years as a mathematics teacher at <a href="https://www.bloomfieldmespolocal.org/"> Bloomfield High School </a> in Northeastern Ohio, where I taught courses ranging from geometry through calculus.
