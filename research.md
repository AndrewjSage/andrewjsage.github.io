My current research focuses primarily on the development and application of methods in statistical machine learning. Below are descriptions of some of my recent projects. 

**Enhancements in Random Forest Methodology**

Since their creation by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm"> Leo Breiman </a> in 2001, random forests have emerged as a powerful prediction technique in classification and regression problems. This tree-based approach is especially popular when working with datasets that contain a large number of predictor variables and potentially complicated interactions. My dissertation proposes a robust procedure designed to improve random forest predictions when there is contamination of the training data. I also study optimal ways to aggregate tree predictions, and the use of random forests to assess variable importance. This research is joint work with my major professors <a href="http://stat.iastate.edu/people/ulrike-genschel"> Ulrike Genschel </a> and <a href="http://stat.iastate.edu/people/dan-nettleton"> Dan Nettleton</a>.

**STEM Retention at Iowa State University**

I am a member of a collaborative team of researchers working to improve student experiences and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors at Iowa State. My collaborators on this project include Professors <a href="https://ge-at.iastate.edu/directory/cinzia-cervato/"> Cinzia Cervato </a> (Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences), <a href="http://stat.iastate.edu/people/ulrike-genschel"> Ulrike Genschel </a> (Statistics), and <a href="http://www.physastro.iastate.edu/directory/cogilvie"> Craig Ogilvie </a> (Physics). I  developed a random forest based approach to estimate the probability of a student leaving STEM within the first year at Iowa State. Advisors of students deemed at-risk are notified so that they can engage in conversations and provide interventions aimed at helping these students succeed in STEM. This work is funded by a grant through the <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/"> Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>.

**Scholarship of Teaching and Learning**

Teaching, like any other science, is furthered by research. By investigating and publishing on effectiveness of the strategies we use in the classroom we gain valuable insight into the learning process. In my Spring 2017 engineering statistics course, students completed a project involving the use of complex, non-textbook data with applications in engineering. Our research focused on the impact of such a project on students' perceptions of the importance of statistical inference. This project is joint work with Ulrike Genschel and was presented at the 2017 <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots17"> United States Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS)</a>.

**Application of Optimization in Statistics**

My 2016 paper, which appeared  in the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-journal-of-operational-research/"> European Journal of Operational Research </a> formulates and solves an integer programming problem that can be used to determine bounds on cell counts in a 2-way contingency table containing rounded conditional probabilities. This problem is of interest in the field of statistical disclosure limitation, which concerns the release of data that is useful for inference and also preserves confidentiality and privacy. This paper resulted from work toward my M.S. degree in mathematics at <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/"> Miami University </a>, and is co-authored by my advisor, <a href="http://www.users.miamioh.edu/wrightse/"> Stephen Wright</a>.
