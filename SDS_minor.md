title: Statistics and Data Science Minor
---
The statistics and data science minor is intended for students majoring in any discipline, who are interested in analyzing data in their work. It might be paired with majors including biology, economics, psychology, computer science, mathematics, and many others. 

Students who earn the mathematics major: statistics track are not eligible to also earn the statistics and data science minor. Students who earn the mathematics major, without the statistics track, are eligible for the statistics and data science minor. 


## Requirements for Statistics and Data Science Minor 

The statistics and data science minor requires 6 courses. At most three may count for any one other major or minor. 

#### Required courses
* Data-Scientific Programming (CMSC/STAT 205)    
* Statistics for Data Science (STAT 255)     

#### Elective Stat/DS Science courses (choose two)    
* Machine Learning (CMSC/STAT 208)     
* Advanced Data Computing (CMSC/STAT 405)     
* Bayesian Statistics (STAT 450)     
* Advanced Statistical Modeling (STAT 455)    

#### Elective Courses  (choose two)
* ANTH 207: Quantitative Analysis in Anthropology
* BIOL 170: Integrative Biology: Experimental Design and Statistics
* BIOL 360: Introduction to Bioinformatics
* BIOL 375: Biostatistics
* BIOL 380: Ecological Modeling
* CHEM 210 / CHEM 211 Analytical Chemistry and Statistical Methods in Analytical Chemistry
* CMSC 210: Introduction to Scientific Programming
* CMSC 470: Artificial Intelligence
* ECON 223: Quantitative Decision Making
* ECON 380: Econometrics
* ECON 481: Advanced Econometrics & Modeling
* ENST 235 / GEOS 214: Climate and Climate Change
* ETST 302: Research Methods in Ethnic Studies
* GOVT 271: Research Methods in Political Science
* GOVT 538: Outside the Margin of Error: Polling and Quantitative Prediction in Modern Politics 
* MATH 340: Probability 
* PSYCH 280: Research Methods I
* PSYCH 281: Research Methods II
* STAT 445: Mathematical Statistics
* STAT 450: Bayesian Statistics

<u> Additional Stipulations </u>   
1. No more than one of ANTH 207 and BIOL 170 may count toward the minor.      
2. The minor requires a total of six distinct courses. Thus, courses (such as STAT 450) that are listed on both lists of electives may count toward one, but not both requirements.
