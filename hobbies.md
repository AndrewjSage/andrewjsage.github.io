I enjoy being outdoors, especially running and hiking. In 2017, I ran my first marathon in Des Moines. I have also completed several half marathons. I have watched baseball games at 18 different ballparks and hope to eventually make it to all 30. Given my love for sports and statistics, it should come as no surprise that I enjoy simulation based sports strategy games like Strat-O-Matic Baseball. I also enjoy reading mystery novels and growing fresh fruit, an interest that goes back generations in my family.
