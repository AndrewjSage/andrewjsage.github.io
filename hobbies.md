I am an avid sports fan and have watched baseball games at 17 different ballparks. I hope to eventually make it to all 30. Given my love for sports and statistics, it should come as no surprise that I enjoy simulation based sports strategy games like Strat-O-Matic and Out of the Park Baseball.

In recent years, I have taken an interest in running and have completed three half-marathons. I also enjoy reading mystery/crime novels and spending time with my sister and brothers.
