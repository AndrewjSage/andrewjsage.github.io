I enjoy being outdoors, especially running, hiking, and going on walks with my energenic lab-mix, Lily. I have completed one marathon and several half marathons. I am an avid baseball fan and have games at 18 different ballparks. I hope to eventually make it to all 30. Given my love for sports and statistics, it should come as no surprise that I enjoy simulation based sports strategy games like Strat-O-Matic and Out of the Park Baseball. I also enjoy reading mystery novels and growing fresh fruit, an interest that goes back generations in my family.
