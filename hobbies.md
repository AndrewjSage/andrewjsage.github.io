I enjoy running and recently completed the 2017 Des Moines Marathon, my first race of that distance. I have also completed four half-marathons.

I am an avid sports fan (Go Cleveland!) and have watched baseball games at 17 different ballparks. I hope to eventually make it to all 30. Given my love for sports and statistics, it should come as no surprise that I enjoy simulation based sports strategy games like Strat-O-Matic Baseball.

Here, my brother and I catch a ballgame together.
