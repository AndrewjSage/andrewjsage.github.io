## Bio

I am an associate professor of statistics at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. I develop and teach statistics and data science courses at all levels of the curriculum, and collaborate with students, colleagues, and community partners to draw insights from data. My research interests include statistical machine learning, statistics education, applied statistical consulting, and sports analytics.   

I hold a Ph.D. in statistics from Iowa State University, as well  M.S. degrees in statistics from Iowa State and mathematics from Miami University, and a B.A. from the The College of Wooster.   

In addition to statistics, I enjoy traveling and sight-seeing, growing apples and berries, attending musicals, running, watching sports (especially baseball), and playing fetch with my dog, Lily.
