Random Forest Methodology </p>

</p>Since their creation by Leo Breiman in 2001, random forests have emerged as a powerful predictive technique. This tree-based approach is especially popular when working with datasets containing a large number of predictor variables, and the potential for complicated interactions. My dissertation proposes a method for improving random forest robustness when training data are contaminated. I also study optimal ways to aggregate tree predictions, and the use of random forests to assess variable importance. My advisors in this work are my major professors Ulrike Genschel and Dan Nettleton.

</p> STEM Retention at Iowa State University

</p> I am a member of a collaborative team of researchers working to improve student experiences and retention in STEM majors at Iowa State. My collaborators on this project include Professors Cinzia Cervato (Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences), Ulrike Genschel (Statistics), and Craig Ogilvie (Physics). I have developed a random forest based approach to estimate the probability of a student leaving STEM within the first year at Iowa State. Advisors of students deemed at-risk are notified so that they can engage in conversations and provide interventions aimed at helping these students succeed in STEM. This work is funded by a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  

</p> Scholarship of Teaching and Learning

</p> Teaching is a science. Investigating and publishing results on effectiveness of strategies we use in the classroom provides valuable isight into the learning process. In my Spring 2017 course in engineering statistics, students completed a project involving the use of complex, non-textbook data with applications in engineering. Our research focused on the impact of such a project on students' perceptions of the importance of statistical inference. This project is joint work with Professor Ulrike Genschel and will be shared at the 2017 United States Conference on Teaching Statistics.

</p> Applications of Optimization in Statistics

</p> My 2016 paper in the European Journal Operations Research formulates and solves an integer programming problem that can be used to determine bounds on cell counts in a 2-way contingency table containing rounded conditional probabilities. This problem is of interest in the field of statistical disclosure limitation, which concerns the release of data that is useful for inference and also preserves confidentiality and privacy. This paper resulted from work toward my M.S. degree in mathematics at Miami University, and is co-authored by my advisor, Professor Stephen Wright.
