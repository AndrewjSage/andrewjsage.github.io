    "text": "A conversation that leads another person to share my enthusiasm statistical investigation carries great intrinsic reward. As a teacher, I get to engage in these conversations every day. I enjoy working closely with students to help them develop the skills and judgement needed to make responsible data-driven decisions and critique faulty arguments they are sure to encounter in their everyday lives. I employ a variety of inclusive pedagogical strategies designed to create a learning-centered environment rooted in high expectations and transparency. I want my students to know that I value them as individuals and care about supporting their success. Most of all, I want them to feel empowered in the knowledge that they are capable of doing hard things.\nI teach a variety of statistics and data classes including:\n\nSTAT 107: Principles of Statistics\nCMSC/STAT 205: Data-Scientific Programming\nSTAT 255: Statistics for Data Science - STAT 255 Class Notes\nMATH/STAT 340: Probability\n\nSTAT 450: Bayesian Statistics\nSTAT 455: Advanced Statistical Modeling\n\nI have found the following references especially insightful in my teaching.\n\nCarver, R., Everson, M., Gabrosek, J., Horton, N., Lock, R., Mocko, M., … & Wood, B.

    "text": "My research interests include statistical learning, statistics education, applied statistical consulting, and sports analytics.\nStatistical learning involves creating and evaluating predictive algorithms, designed to “learn” from and adapt to information contained in complex, noisy data. My research focuses on  random forest methodology . My latest article  “From Black Box to Shining Spotlight”  introduces a set of web applications (1, 2) visualizing random forest prediction intervals and comparing them with intervals produced by linear regression models. I have also published articles introducing  a residual-based approach to robust random forest regression ,  evaluating techniques for aggregating random forest predictions across trees , and  using random forests to improve college student retention in STEM majors.\nI also enjoy working collaboratively with social science colleagues to analyze data collected in their studies. I am currently working with a psychology colleague on a study examining the effect of mindfulness and mood-monitoring strategies on mental health of colleague students.\nFinally, I enjoy applying statistical methods to sports data and have supervised several student projects in this area. One of these projects, by Derek Brickley, examined relationships between colleges’ and universities’ academic and athletic performances and  was published in SIAM Undergraduate Research Online in 2022.\n\nPublications\nSage, A.
