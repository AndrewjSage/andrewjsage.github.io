   Welcome! I am an assistant professor of statistics at <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/">Lawrence University</a>. I enjoy teaching and working collaboratively to find meaning in complex data. My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining, and statistics education.

Prior to that, I earned M.S. and B.A. degrees in mathematics from <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/"> Miami University</a> and <a href="http://www.wooster.edu/"> The College of Wooster </a>, respectively.
