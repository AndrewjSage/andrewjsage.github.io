   I earned my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.stat.iastate.edu/"> statistics </a> from <a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a> in Spring 2018. I am excited to join the faculty of <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/">Lawrence University</a> as  assistant professor of statistics in Fall 2018. 
  
  </p> Working with students invigorates me and I and look forward to engaging closely with undergraduates in my teaching and research. 
  
    </p> My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining, and statistics education. As a member of an interdisciplinary team, I use predictive analytics to improve student experiences and retention in STEM majors at Iowa State. 
    
    </p>I grew up in Ohio, where I earned my B.A. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from <a href="http://www.wooster.edu/"> The College of Wooster </a> and <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/"> Miami University</a>, respectively.
