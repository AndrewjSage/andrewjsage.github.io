    I am a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. I expect to earn my Ph.D. in Spring 2018. I am passionate about teaching statistics and plan to pursue a faculty position at an institution that highly values teaching and mentoring undergraduate research.
    
    My teaching experience includes a range of introductory and intermediate undergraduate courses in statistics and mathematics. My research interests include statistical machine learning and data mining. As a member of interdisciplinary team, I apply techniques in these fields, in an effort to improve STEM retention at Iowa State. Please see my teaching and research pages for more information.
