    I am a graduate student in the <a href="http://www.stat.iastate.edu/"> Department of Statistics </a> at <a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a>. I expect to earn my Ph.D. in Spring 2018.
    
    </p> I enjoy teaching statistics and I look forward to working with closely with undergraduate students through teaching and mentoring undergraduate research at a liberal arts college. 
   
    </p> My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining, and statistics education. As a member of an interdisciplinary team, I use predictive analytics to improve student experiences and retention in STEM majors at Iowa State. 
    
    </p>I grew up in Ohio, where I earned my B.A. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from <a href="http://www.wooster.edu/"> The College of Wooster </a> and <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/"> Miami University</a>, respectively.
