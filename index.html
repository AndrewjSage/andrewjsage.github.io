   <p> Welcome! I am an assistant professor of statistics at <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/">Lawrence University</a>. I enjoy teaching and working collaboratively to find meaning in complex data. My research interests include statistical machine learning, applied statistics, sports analytics, and statistics education. </p>
   
   <p>I am especially excited about new opportunities for students to study statistics and data science at Lawrence. These include a <a href="https://andrewjsage.github.io/stat_track/">statistics track</a> within the mathematics major, and a <a href="https://andrewjsage.github.io/SDS_minor/"> statistics and data science minor</a>. Here are descriptions of <a href="https://andrewjsage.github.io/stat_courses/">statistics courses</a> offered at Lawrence.    
   
  
   <p> I earned my Ph.D. in statistics from <a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a> in 2018. Prior to that, I earned M.S. and B.A. degrees in mathematics from <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/"> Miami University</a> and <a href="http://www.wooster.edu/"> The College of Wooster</a>, respectively. I enjoyed teaching high school mathematics in Northeastern Ohio from 2007-2011. </p>
