    I am a graduate student in the <a href="http://www.stat.iastate.edu/"> Department of Statistics </a> at <a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a>. I expect to earn my Ph.D. in Spring 2018. Working with students inspires me and I hope to join the faculty of an institution that highly values teaching and the mentoring of undergraduate researchers.
   
    </p>I have experience teaching a wide range of introductory and intermediate undergraduate courses in statistics and mathematics. My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining, and statistics education. As a member of an interdisciplinary team, I use predictive analytics to improve student experiences and retention in STEM majors at Iowa State.
