   <p> Welcome! I am an assistant professor of statistics at <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/">Lawrence University</a>. I enjoy teaching and working collaboratively to find meaning in complex data. My research interests include statistical machine learning, applied statistics, sports analytics, and statistics education. </p>
   
   <p> I have been a faculty member in Lawrence's  Department of <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/academics/study/mathematics"> Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/academics/study/computer_science/"> Computer Science</a> since Fall 2018. I am excited about increasing the statistics and data science opportunities available for Lawrence students. If you are interested in discussing Lawrence's new statistics and data science minor, or statistics track within the mathematics major, I would love to talk with you! </p>
  
   <p> I earned my Ph.D. in statistics </a> from <a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a> in 2018. Prior to that, I earned M.S. and B.A. degrees in mathematics from <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/"> Miami University</a> and <a href="http://www.wooster.edu/"> The College of Wooster</a>, respectively. I enjoyed teaching high school mathematics in Northeastern Ohio from 2007-2011. </p>
